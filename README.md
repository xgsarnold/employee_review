#Employee Reviews

This program will enable users to create employees and track their name, email, phone, and salary. Users will also be able to add reviews to each employee which can be scanned for positive or negative keywords to determine quickly whether an employee deserves a raise.

These employees may be added to departments which the user can also create. Users can target either employees or whole departments in order to give out raises and change salaries.

To finish the foundational application, it will likely require 8 hours, while enabling the program to add parameters for which deserving employees should receive raises and equipping the program with the means to search reviews in order to determine an employee's worth will likely each require 4 hours a piece.
